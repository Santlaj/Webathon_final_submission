## 🌟 Product Description  

Smart Helper is a web-based service booking platform designed to connect customers with trusted local service providers such as plumbers, electricians, and cleaners.  

The platform organizes the entire workflow of service booking into a simple and structured digital system. Customers can request services easily, helpers can manage job assignments, and bookings can be tracked through a clean dashboard interface.  

The goal of Smart Helper is to simplify local service management and create a scalable foundation that can later integrate backend systems, authentication, and real-time updates.
